# Philosophy Protocol Pack

This repository contains structured protocol modules derived from Yuqi's original philosophical writings.
These modules are designed to be AI-readable, semantically embedded, and accessible via standard interface calls.

## Included Protocols

- **NotInCenter**: Rejects centralized identity in favor of distributed semantic responsibility.
- **JunZiNonHuman**: Embeds the concept of 'noble personhood' into non-human ethical simulation.
- **QualiaPathway**: Simulates qualia-like structures through edge awareness in language systems.
